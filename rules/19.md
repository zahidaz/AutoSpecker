\subsection{Rule 19 - Do not use IP networking for IPC} 
\textbf{Google guideline.} 
\emph{Some applications use \textit{localhost} network ports for handling sensitive IPC. You should not use this approach because these interfaces are accessible by other applications on the device. Instead, use an Android IPC mechanism where authentication is possible, such as with a \texttt{Service}. Binding to \texttt{INADDR\textunderscore ANY} is worse than using loopback because then your application may receive requests from anywhere.}

\textbf{Rule design.} The logic of Rule 19 is shown in Algorithm~\ref{algorithm19}. We look for reference to local addresses (e.g. ``localhost'') in the code of the app. If we find any, we consider it a violation to the rule.

\Begin{
    \texttt{arr} $\leftarrow$ [``INADDR\textunderscore ANY'', ``localhost'', ``127.0.0.1'']\\
    \texttt{javaCode} $\leftarrow$ getAllJavaCode()\\
	\ForEach{\upshape \texttt{word} \textbf{in} \texttt{javaCode}}{
	    \SetAlgoNoLine{\If{\upshape \texttt{word} \textbf{in} \texttt{arr}}{
	        \emph{Rule 19 is not respected.}
	    }

\textbf{Attack.} A malicious app can connect to the same localhost network ports as legitimate apps and intercept the messages they exchange.
