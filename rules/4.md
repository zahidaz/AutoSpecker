#### Rule 4 - Use intents to defer permissions

**Google guideline.** *Whenever possible, don't add a permission to your app to complete an action that could be completed in another app. Instead, use an intent to defer the request to a different app that already has the necessary permission.*

The following example shows how to use an intent to direct users to a contacts app instead of requesting the `READ_CONTACTS` and `WRITE_CONTACTS` permissions:

```java
// Delegates the responsibility of creating the
// contact to a contacts app, which has already
// been granted the appropriate WRITE_CONTACTS
// permission.
Intent insertContactIntent = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_INSERT);
insertContactIntent.setType(ContactsContract.Contacts.CONTENT_TYPE);

// Make sure that the user has a contacts app
// installed on their device.
if (insertContactIntent.resolveActivity(getPackageManager()) != null) {
  startActivity(insertContactIntent);
}
```

*In addition, if your app needs to perform file-based I/O -- such as accessing storage or choosing a file -- it doesn't need special permissions because the system can complete the operations on your app's behalf. Better still, after a user selects content at a particular URI, the calling app is granted permission to the selected resource.*

**Rule design.** The logic of Rule 4 is shown below. We get the list of permissions requested by the app from its manifest, and compare it with a "blacklist" of permissions for the actions that could be completed by other apps (e.g. instead of requesting the `SEND_SMS` permission, an app can delegate the action to the SMS app). If the app requests any of the blacklisted permissions, we consider it a violation to the rule. 

```python
def rule_4():
    permissions = getAllPermissions()
    for perm in permissions:
        if perm in blacklist:
            return "Rule 4 is not respected."
```

**Attack.** The attack that can exploit the vulnerability detected by Rule 4 is the same as the one for Rule 3.

Again, please note that the algorithm is presented here in a Python-like pseudocode. The actual implementation might differ based on the programming language and specific APIs you're using.
