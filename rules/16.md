## Rule 16 - Erase data in WebView cache 

**Google Guideline.** If your application accesses sensitive data with a WebView, you may want to use the `clearCache()` method to delete any files stored locally. You can also use server-side headers such as `no-cache` to indicate that an application should not cache particular content.

**Rule design.** The logic of Rule 16 is shown in Algorithm~\ref{algorithm16}. We check if the app clears the cache of all the WebView objects it uses.

```java
Algorithm~\ref{algorithm16}
\SetAlgoLined
\Begin{
	\texttt{webViews} $\leftarrow$ getAllWebViewVars()\\
	\ForEach{\upshape \texttt{webView} \textbf{in} \texttt{webViews}}{
        \SetAlgoNoLine{\If{\upshape \textbf{not} usesClearCache(\texttt{webView})}{
        \emph{Rule 16 is not respected.}
    }}
	}
}
\caption{\change{Erase data in WebView cache}}
\label{algorithm16}
```

**Attack.** If an app uses a WebView object and does not clear its cache through the `clearCache()` method, any malicious code running within the app UID (e.g., third-party libraries) can access the data saved in the cache.
