\subsection{Rule 31 - Do not migrate private information to device encrypted storage} 
\textbf{Google guideline.} \emph{If a user updates their device to use Direct Boot mode, you might have existing data that needs to get migrated to device encrypted storage. Use \texttt{Context.moveSharedPreferencesFrom()} and \texttt{Context.moveDatabaseFrom()} to migrate preference and database data between credential encrypted storage and device encrypted storage.
\\
Use your best judgment when deciding what data to migrate from credential encrypted storage to device encrypted storage. You should not migrate private user information, such as passwords or authorization tokens, to device encrypted storage. In some scenarios, you might need to manage separate sets of data in the two encrypted stores.}

\textbf{Rule design.} The logic of Rule 31 is shown in Algorithm~\ref{algorithm31}. If the application tries to migrate data to the device encrypted storage, we show a warning to remind the user that private information, such as passwords or authorization tokens, should not be stored in device encrypted storage.

\textbf{Attack.} The device encrypted storage is accessible to apps before the user unlocks the screen of the device for the first time after boot. An attacker could exploit this to get access to sensitive information without needing the user to unlock the device.
