## Rule 12 - Use SharedPreferences in private mode 

**Google guideline.** When using creating or accessing your app's `SharedPreferences` objects, use `MODE_PRIVATE`. That way, only your app can access the information within the shared preferences file.

If you want to share data across apps, don't use `SharedPreferences` objects. Instead, you should follow the necessary steps to share data securely across apps.

**Rule design.** The logic of Rule 12 is shown in Algorithm~\ref{algorithm12}. We get the list of `SharedPreferences` objects opened by the app and verify that they are opened in private mode. If any of the SharedPreferences objects is opened in a different mode, we consider it a violation of the rule.

```java
Algorithm~\ref{algorithm12}
\SetAlgoLined
\Begin{
    \texttt{s1} $\leftarrow$ [``getSharedPreferences'', ``getPreferences'']\\
    \texttt{s2} $\leftarrow$ "MODE\textunderscore PRIVATE"\\
    \texttt{methods} $\leftarrow$ getAllCalledMethods()\\
	\ForEach{\upshape \texttt{method} \textbf{in} \texttt{methods}}{
	    \If{\upshape \texttt{method} \textbf{in} \texttt{s1}}{
	        \texttt{mode} $\leftarrow$ getModeArg(\texttt{method})\\
	        \SetAlgoNoLine{\If{\upshape \textbf{not} \texttt{mode} = \texttt{s2}}{
	            \emph{Rule 12 is not respected.}
	        }}
	    }
	}
}

**Attack.** If an app accesses its `SharedPreferences` without the `MODE_PRIVATE`, a malicious app on the same device can access the same and read/modify the stored information.
