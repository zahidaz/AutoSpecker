\subsection{Rule 29 - Choose a recommended cryptographic algorithm} 

\textbf{Google Guideline.} \emph{When you have the freedom to choose which algorithm to use (such as when you do not require compatibility with a third-party system), we recommend using the following algorithms:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \texttt{Cipher} class: AES in CBC or GCM mode with 256-bit keys (such as \texttt{AES}/\texttt{GCM}/\texttt{NoPadding})
	\item \texttt{MessageDigest} class: SHA-2 family (e.g., \texttt{SHA-256})
	\item \texttt{Mac} class: SHA-2 family HMAC (e.g., \texttt{HMACSHA256})
	\item \texttt{Signature} class: SHA-2 family with ECDSA (e.g., \texttt{SHA256withECDSA})
\end{itemize}
} % end of emph

\textbf{Rule design.} The logic of Rule 29 is shown in Algorithm~\ref{algorithm29}. We inspect all the invocations to crypto methods, and verify if they are called with insecure arguments.

	    }}
	}

\textbf{Attack.} If an app does not properly use cryptographic algorithms or it uses insecure ones, a malicious app can break and access to any data or communication, which should have been protected by cryptography.
