\subsection{Rule 30 - Do not use deprecated cryptographic functionality}
\textbf{Google guideline.} \emph{The following subsections describe deprecated functionality that you should no longer use in your app.}

\subsubsection{Bouncy Castle algorithms}
\emph{A number of algorithms from the "Bouncy Castle provider"\footnote{https://www.bouncycastle.org/} that are also provided by another provider have been depracated in Android P. This only affects cases where the implementation from the Bouncy Castle provider is explicitly requested, such as \texttt{Cipher.getInstance("AES/CBC/PKCS7PADDING",\allowbreak "BC"} or \texttt{Cipher.getInstance("AES/CBC/PKCS7PADD-\allowbreak ING"}, \texttt{Security.getProvider("BC"))}. Requesting a specific provider is discouraged, so if you follow that guideline this deprecation should not affect you. }

\subsubsection{Password-based encryption ciphers without an IV}
\emph{Password-based encryption (PBE) ciphers that require an initialization vector (IV) can obtain it from the key, if it's suitably constructed, or from an explicitly-passed IV. When passing a PBE key that doesn't contain an IV and no explicit IV, the PBE ciphers on Android currently assume an IV of zero.
\\
When using PBE ciphers, always pass an explicit IV, as shown in the following code snippet:}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Java, caption=Password-based encryption ciphers without an IV, numbers=none]
 SecretKey key = ...;
 Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(
  "PBEWITHSHA256AND256BITAES-CBC-BC");
 byte[] iv = new byte[16];
 new SecureRandom().nextBytes(iv);
 cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, key, new IvParameterSpec(iv));

\end{lstlisting}

\textbf{Rule design.} The logic of Rule 30 is shown in Algorithm~\ref{algorithm30}. We look at the code of the app. If the app calls the \texttt{Cipher.getInstance()} method with an explicit provider, or if it uses PBE ciphers without proper initialization, we consider it a violation to the rule.

	        }}
	    }
	}

\textbf{Attack.} When deprecated and insecure crytographic algorithms are used, a malicious app can decrypt any sensitive data previously encrypted by the legitimate app.
