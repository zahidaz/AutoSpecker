\subsection{Rule 27 - Configure CAs for debugging} 
\textbf{Google guideline.} \emph{When debugging an app that connects over HTTPS, you may want to connect to a local development server, which does not have the SSL certificate for your production server. In order to support this without any modification to your app's code, you can specify debug-only CAs, which are trusted only when \texttt{android:debuggable} is true, by using \texttt{debug-overrides}. Normally, IDEs and build tools set this flag automatically for non-release builds.
\\
This is safer than the usual conditional code because, as a security precaution, app stores do not accept apps which are marked debuggable. 
\\
\texttt{res/xml/network\textunderscore security\textunderscore config.xml}:}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=XML_android, caption=Configure CAs for debugging, numbers=none]
 <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
 <network-security-config>
   <debug-overrides>
     <trust-anchors>
       <certificates src="@raw/debug_cas"/>
     </trust-anchors>
   </debug-overrides>
 </network-security-config>

\end{lstlisting}

\textbf{Rule design.} The logic of Rule 27 is shown in Algorithm~\ref{algorithm27}. We look at the manifest of the app. If the app has debugging enabled, and the network configuration defines a debug override, we show a warning.

    	    }
    	}

\textbf{Attack.} Using conditional code to handle connection to a local development server could lead to mistakes in production builds. If developers forget this conditional code, or this conditional code is not well managed, then an attacker could exploit these mistakes and perform a man-in-the-middle attack.
