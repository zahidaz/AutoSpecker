## Rule 7 - Use WebView objects carefully

**Google guideline.** *Whenever possible, load only whitelisted content in `WebView` objects. In other words, the `WebView` objects in your app shouldn't allow users to navigate to sites that are outside of your control.*

**Rule design.** The logic of Rule 7 is shown below. Developers can use a custom `WebViewClient` to check the URLs that a `WebView` loads. We find violations to Rule 7 by checking if an app has any `WebView` object that does not use a custom `WebViewClient` to check the loaded URLs.

```python
def rule_7():
    webViews = getAllWebViewVars()
    whitelistedViews = getSetWebViewClient()
    for view in webViews:
        if view not in whitelistedViews or not isOverridingUrlLoading(view):
            return "Rule 7 is not respected."
```

**Attack.** `WebView` objects are responsible for rendering the web code either belonging to external resources (e.g., a website) or saved in an app. If a `WebView` object loads any website and does not refer to a specific whitelist, an attacker might make the `WebView` object load a malicious website, which has JavaScript code running on the client side and able to steal sensitive information (e.g., cookies).
