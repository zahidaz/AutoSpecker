## Rule 1 - Show an app chooser

**Google Guideline.** *If an implicit intent can launch at least two possible apps on a user's device, explicitly show an app chooser. This interaction strategy allows users to transfer sensitive information to an app that they trust.*

```java
Intent intent = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_SEND);
List<ResolveInfo> possibleActivitiesList = queryIntentActivities(intent, PackageManager.MATCH_ALL);

// Verify that an activity in at least two apps on 
// the user's device can handle the intent. 
// Otherwise, start the intent only if an app on 
// the user's device can handle the intent.
if (possibleActivitiesList.size() > 1) {

  // Create intent to show chooser.
  // Title is something similar to "Share this 
  // photo with".

  String title = getResources().getString(R.string.chooser_title);
  Intent chooser = Intent.createChooser(intent, title);
  startActivity(chooser);
} else if (intent.resolveActivity(
  getPackageManager()) != null) {
  startActivity(intent);
}
```

**Rule design.** The logic of Rule 1 is shown in Algorithm~1, where we inspect all implicit intents used by an app, and verify that `Intent.createChooser()` is called on these intents. If an Intent is constructed as implicit, but `Intent.createChooser()` is not called on that intent, we mark it as a violation.


### Algorithm 1 - Show an app chooser

1. Get all implicit intents used by the app.
2. Get all intents where `Intent.createChooser()` is called.
3. For each intent in implicit intents:
   - If the intent is not in chooser intents, mark it as a violation.


**Attack.** The attack aims at intercepting an implicit `Intent` that is originally sent to a legitimate app but is intercepted by a malicious one without any user notification. To complete the attack, a malicious app exploits the implicit `Intent` forwarding system of the Android OS and the absence of an app chooser. Thus, by declaring the `Intent Filter` associated with the target implicit `Intent` with the highest priority, the malicious app becomes the recipient of the implicit `Intent`, which will be successfully delivered to the malicious app since no app chooser will be shown.
