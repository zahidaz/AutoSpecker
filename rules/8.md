## Rule 8 - Store private data within internal storage 

**Google guideline.** Store all private user data within the device's internal storage, which is sandboxed per app. Your app doesn't need to request permission to view these files, and other apps cannot access the files. As an added security measure, when the user uninstalls an app, the device deletes all files that the app saved within internal storage.

The following code snippet demonstrates one way to write data to storage:

```java
// Creates a file with this name, or replaces an
// existing file that has the same name. Note that
// the file name cannot contain path separators.
final String FILE_NAME = "sensistive_info.txt";
String fileContents = "This is some top-secret information!";

FileOutputStream fos = openFileOutput(FILE_NAME, Context.MODE_PRIVATE);
fos.write(fileContents.getBytes());
fos.close();
```

The following code snippet shows the inverse operation, reading data from storage:

```java
// The file name cannot contain path separators.
final String FILE_NAME = "sensitive_info.txt";
FileInputStream fis = openFileInput(FILE_NAME);

// available() determines the approximate number of
// bytes that can be read without blocking.
int bytesAvailable = fis.available();
StringBuilder topSecretFileContents = new StringBuilder(bytesAvailable);

// Make sure that read() returns a number of bytes
// that is equal to the file's size.
byte[] fileBuffer = new byte[bytesAvailable];
while (fis.read(fileBuffer) != -1) {
  topSecretFileContents.append(fileBuffer);
}
```

**Rule design.** The logic of Rule 8 is shown in Algorithm~\ref{algorithm8}.  We check if all output files are opened in private mode. If any output file is opened in a different mode, we consider it a violation to the rule. 

```java
Algorithm~\ref{algorithm8}
\SetAlgoLined
\Begin{
    \texttt{s1} $\leftarrow$ ``openFileOutput''\\
    \texttt{s2} $\leftarrow$ "MODE\textunderscore PRIVATE"\\
    \texttt{methods} $\leftarrow$ getAllCalledMethods()\\
	\ForEach{\upshape \texttt{method} \textbf{in} \texttt{methods}}{
	    \If{\upshape \texttt{method} = \texttt{s1}}{
	        \texttt{mode} $\leftarrow$ getModeArg(\texttt{method})\\
	        \SetAlgoNoLine{\If{\upshape \textbf{not} \texttt{mode} = \texttt{s2}}{
	            \emph{Rule 8 is not respected.}
	        }}
	    }
	}
}

**Attack.** An attacker can read and pollute data since they are not stored in the app private internal storage. Moreover, through a a *Man-in-the-Disk* attack, an attacker can intercept and potentially alter data while they are extracted by an app from the external storage.
