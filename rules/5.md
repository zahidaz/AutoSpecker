## Rule 5 - Use SSL traffic

**Google Guideline.** _If your app communicates with a web server that has a certificate issued by a well-known, trusted CA, the HTTPS request is very simple:_

```java
URL url = new URL("https://www.google.com");
HttpsURLConnection urlConnection = (HttpsURLConnection) url.openConnection();
urlConnection.connect();
InputStream in = urlConnection.getInputStream();
```

**Rule design.** The logic of Rule 5 is shown in Algorithm 5. We first search for invocations of the `URL.openConnection()` method. If the return value of such invocations is cast to `HttpURLConnection` and not to `HttpsURLConnection`, we consider it a violation. Additionally, we check if the connections have a `TrustManager` or handle the exceptions.

```

**Attack.** The `SSLSocketFactory` can be used to validate the identity of an HTTPS server against a list of trusted certificates and to authenticate to the HTTPS server using a private key.

If HTTPS is not used, or it is used without a validation of the HTTPS server through the `SSLSocketFactory`, a _Man-in-the-Middle_ attack can be performed, i.e., an attacker can secretly relay and alter the communication between two parties.
