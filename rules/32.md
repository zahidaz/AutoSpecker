\subsection{Rule 32 - Use device encrypted storage for Direct Boot only} 
\textbf{Google guideline.} \emph{Use device encrypted storage only for information that must be accessible during Direct Boot mode. Do not use device encrypted storage as a general-purpose encrypted store.}

\textbf{Rule design.} The logic of Rule 32 is shown in Algorithm~\ref{algorithm32}. If the application tries to access the device encrypted storage, we show a warning to remind that device encrypted storage should only be used for data that needs to be accessed before the user unlocks the device for the first time.

\textbf{Attack.} The device encrypted storage is accessible to apps before the user unlocks the screen of the device for the first time. An attacker could exploit this to get access to sensitive information without needing the user to unlock the device after boot.
