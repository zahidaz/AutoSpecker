## Rule 10 - Use scoped directory access 

**Google guideline.** If your app needs to access only a specific directory within the device's external storage, you can use scoped directory access to limit your app's access to a device's external storage accordingly. As a convenience to users, your app should save the directory access URI so that users don't need to approve access to the directory every time your app attempts to access it.

**Note**: if you use scoped directory access with a particular directory in external storage, know that the user might eject the media containing this storage while your app is running. You should include logic to gracefully handle the change to the `Environment.getExternalStorageState()` return value that this user behavior causes.

The following code snippet uses scoped directory access with the pictures directory within a device's primary shared storage:

```java
private static final int PICTURES_DIR_ACCESS_REQUEST_CODE = 42;

private void accessExternalPicturesDirectory() {
  StorageManger sm = (StorageManager) getSystemService(Context.STORAGE_SERVICE);
  StorageVolume = sm.getPrimaryStorageVolume();
  Intent intent = volume.createAccessIntent(Environment.DIRECTORY_PICTURES);
  startActivityForResult(intent, PICTURES_DIR_ACCESS_REQUEST_CODE);
}

...

@Override
public void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent resultData) {
  if (requestCode==PICTURES_DIR_ACCESS_REQUEST_CODE && resultCode == Activity.RESULT_OK) {

    // User approved access to scoped directory in
    // your app
    if (resultData != null) {
      Uri picturesDirUri = resultData.getData();

      // Save user's approval for accessing this
      // directory in your app
      ContentResolver myContentResolver = getContentResolver();
      myContentResolver.takePersistableUriPermission(picturesDirUri, Intent.FLAG_GRANT_READ_URI_PERMISSION);
    }
  }
}
```

**Warning**: don't pass null into `createAccessIntent()` unnecessarily because this grants your app access to the entire volume that `StorageManager` finds for your app.

**Rule design.** The logic of Rule 10 is shown in Algorithm~\ref{algorithm10}. We check if the app requests external storage permissions. If it does, we consider it a violation to the rule.

```java
Algorithm~\ref{algorithm10}
\SetAlgoLined
\Begin{
    \texttt{arr} $\leftarrow$ [``READ\textunderscore EXTERNAL\textunderscore STORAGE'', ``WRITE\textunderscore EXTERNAL\textunderscore STORAGE'']\\
	\texttt{permissions} $\leftarrow$ getAllPermissions()\\
	\ForEach{\upshape \texttt{perm} \textbf{in} \texttt{permissions}}{
	    \SetAlgoNoLine\If{\upshape \texttt{perm} \textbf{in} \texttt{arr}}{
			   \emph{Rule 10 is not respected.}
	    }}
}
\caption{Use scoped directory access}
\label{algorithm10}
```

**Attack.** As for Rule 3, according to which an app should declare the minimum number of permissions, Rule 10 aims to prevent any malicious code running within the same UID of the app from having access to the whole external storage. Thus, if Rule 10 is not respected and the app has access to the external storage, any malicious code running inside it can not only compromise the app files but also the ones belonging to other apps.
