\subsection{Rule 25 - Do not disable hostname verification}

\textbf{Google guideline.} \emph{\textbf{Caution}: Replacing \texttt{HostnameVerifier} can be \textit{very dangerous} if the other virtual host is not under your control, because a man-in-the-middle attack could direct traffic to another server without your knowledge.
\\
If you are still sure you want to override hostname verification, here is an example that replaces the verifier for a single \texttt{URLConnection} with one that still verifies that the hostname is at least on expected by the app:}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Java, caption= problems with hostname verification, numbers=none]
 // Create an HostnameVerifier that hardwires the
 // expected hostname. Note that is different than
 // the URL's hostname: example.com versus
 // example.org
 HostnameVerifier verifier = new HostnameVerifier(){
   @Override
   public boolean verify(String hostname, SSLSession session) {
     HostnameVerifier hv=HttpsURLConnection.getDefaultHostnameVerifier();
     return hv.verify("example.com", session);
   }
 };

 // Tell the URLConnection to use our
 // HostnameVerifier
 URL url = new URL("https://example.org/");
 HttpsURLConnection urlConnection =
   (HttpsURLConnection)url.openConnection();
 urlConnection.setHostnameVerifier(verifier);
 InputStream in = urlConnection.getInputStream();
 copyInputStreamToOutputStream(in, System.out);

\end{lstlisting}

\textbf{Rule design.} The logic of Rule 25 is shown in Algorithm~\ref{algorithm25}. We look for HttpsUrlConnection objects used by the app. If any of them overrides the default hostname verifier, we consider it a violation to the rule.

	\texttt{connections} $\leftarrow$ getAllHttpsUrlConnections()\\
	\ForEach{\upshape \texttt{connection} \textbf{in} \texttt{connections}}{
	    \SetAlgoNoLine{\If{\upshape hasSetHostnameVerifier(\texttt{connection})}{
	        \emph{Rule 25 is not respected.}
	    }}
	}
}

\textbf{Attack.} A malicious app can perform a man-in-the-middle attack by redirecting the traffic, originally sent to a legitimate server, towards another malicious one.
